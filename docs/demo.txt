Demo

This project uses its own documentation for demo and tests.
Have a look at the `project's code repository`_:

* `docs/ folder`_ contains the documentation.
* `Makefile`_ has a "test" target that runs sphinxcontrib-testbuild tests
  with nose.
* `etc/nose.cfg`_ holds nose configuration.

See also `test reports on Travis-CI.org`_.
