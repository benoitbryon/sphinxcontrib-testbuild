Usage
#####

Here are guidelines about sphinxcontrib-testbuild usage.


**************************
Default: using conventions
**************************

sphinxcontrib.testbuild uses these conventions as default configuration:

* There is a Makefile with a "documentation" target in project's root folder.
* Sphinx-based documentation is located in "docs/" folder relative to project's
  root.
* There is a "docs/Makefile", which contains ``sphinx-build`` executable
  location as ``SPHINXBUILD`` and build directory as ``BUILDDIR``.

Run tests with Python's standard ``unittest``:

.. code-block:: sh

   # cd path/to/your/project/, i.e. where there is a Makefile and a docs/
   python -m unittest sphinxcontrib.testbuild.tests

Using ``nosetests``:

.. code-block:: sh

   bin/nosetests sphinxcontrib.testbuild.tests


**********************************
Using a custom SphinxBuildTestCase
**********************************

Extend and customize :py:class:`sphinxcontrib.testbuild.SphinxBuildTestCase`
class in some test suite of yours. Then run your test suite as usual.
