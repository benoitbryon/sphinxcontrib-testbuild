As a documentation writer, I want to include documentation builds inside my
continuous integration test suite, so that I'm aware of documentation build
status.

sphinxcontrib.testbuild implements such tests for Sphinx, in Python.

http://docs.writethedocs.org provides recipes and conventions about
documentation. sphinxcontrib.testbuild has been created as part of the
WriteTheDocs toolkit, as an implementation of "test your documentation builds"
recommendation.
